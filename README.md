# Roberta Emotional Analysis Model

This project utilizes a fine-tuned [RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/roberta) model to perform emotional analysis on text data. The model is capable of identifying various emotions in textual inputs, helping to provide deeper insights into sentiment and emotional tones in text.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a model that accurately classifies the emotional content of text inputs. By leveraging RoBERTa's robust language understanding, this model can categorize text into various emotional states, providing valuable insights for applications like customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and personal sentiment tracking.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- A GPU is recommended for faster processing (optional)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/maria-saif20/-RoBERTa-emotional-model.git
    cd roberta_emotional_model
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the necessary RoBERTa model from Hugging Face:
    ```python
    from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("roberta-base")
    model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("roberta-base")
    ```

## Usage

To use the model, simply open the `roberta_emotional_model.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions within. Below is a sample code snippet on how to perform inference with the trained model:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

# Load the model and tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("path_to_your_fine_tuned_model")
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("path_to_your_fine_tuned_model")

# Predict emotion
text = "I am so happy to see this!"
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
predicted_emotion = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1)
print(f"Predicted emotion: {predicted_emotion}")
